# CodingWorkPortfolio
A portfolio of my coding - from undergraduate to my short time as a postgraduate.
In this github repository you will find all the projects and work I have done on my undergraduate degree and also for the few months that I worked as a postgraduate.
The repository is structured into labelled folders that include which year the work was created and the module/topic it was associated with.
