# CodingWorkPortfolio
A portfolio of my coding work, as well as presentations and reports - from undergraduate to my short time as a postgraduate.
In this github repository you will find all the projects and work I have done on my undergraduate degree and also for the few months that I worked as a postgraduate.
The purpose is to give you an idea of the breadth and depth of topics in computational and statistical mathematics that I have delved into over the last 5 years. 

The repository is structured into labelled folders that include the year the work was created and the module/topic it was associated with. Not all of the reports are
accompanied by the code used to generate them (i.e. R Markdown files or function files). Furthermore, for larger projects with a number of files, zipped folders have been made available which cannot be directly accessed in github. This has been done to keep the navigation simple, as there is already a significant number of files in this repository and as mentioned above, the purpose is simply to give an idea of the breadth and depth of topics covered. If you are interested, you can download these files and look at them yourself. 

The zip folders predominantly involve C++ code, for which there are many source and header files. Still, there is C++ code (namely that from a class test) that can be viewed directly in the repository. This can be treated as a snippet hinting at the types of topics covered, which are expanded upon in the zip folders. 

I provide here a short (and truncated) summary of the topics the code were written for:
- Exploratory multivariate analysis of athletic performance (which can be found in MMath/1st year/R)
- Plotting and Fourier series plus composite numerical integration methods (which can be found in MMath/1st year/MATLAB)
- Root finding, Gaussian elimination and pivoting variants, iterative techniques for linear systems, polynomial interpolation, numerical methods for IVPs (which can be found in MMath/2nd year/Introduction to Scientific Computation)
- Linear models applied to data on birthweights and mortality rates (which can be found in MMath/2nd year/Statistical models and methods)
- Simulation and probability analysis of the dice game Mexico, and supervised machine learning models for credit scoring (which can be found in MMath/3rd year/Data analysis and modelling)
- Finite difference and shooting methods for initial and boundary value problems plus eigenvalue problems (MMath/3rd year/Scientific computation and numerical analysis)
- Solving PDEs through numerical methods (MMath/3rd year/Scientific computation and numerical analysis)
- Mathematical problems in C++, including root-finding and solving a system of ODEs. The latter is tested on a system of celestial objects subject to gravitational forces, and includes an asteroid collision with Earth (zip folder for CW2, MMath/4th year/C++)
- Cubic spline interpolation, least squares and gaussian quadrature, plus further methods for solving PDEs numerically (MMath/4th year/Computational applied maths)
- Non-linear regression, Gaussian processes, solving inverse problems using Bayesian techniques (MMath/4th year/Uncertainty quantification)
- Stochastic numerical methods of various orders of accuracy and analysis (MMath/4th year/Dissertation)
- Optimisation and practical asymptotic inference (MRes/Applied statistical inference)
- Gibbs sampling from the NxN Ising model (MRes/Gibbs sampling)
- Image processing of X-ray data (MRes/Integrated Research Project)
- Monte Carlo integration (MRes/Other)
- The quantum HHL algorithm (MRes/Quantum computing)
